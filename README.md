### What I learned

I learned how to create a rating component using JavaScript, HTML and CSS. I learned how to use the forEach method in JavaScript to loop through an array of elements and perform certain actions on each of them. I also learned how to add and remove classes on elements based on certain conditions. I became familiar with the concept of event listeners and how they can be used to trigger functions when a specific event occurs, such as a click. Additionally, I gained knowledge on how to use CSS transitions to create animations between different styles.

Overall, this project allowed me to expand my understanding of JavaScript, HTML and CSS, and how they can be used together to create dynamic and interactive web pages.
